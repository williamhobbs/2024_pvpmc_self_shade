Description:,,,,,,,,"degrees North (decimal, positive for northern hemisphere)","degrees East (decimal, negative for western hemisphere)",altitude above sea level in meters,"Type of mounting/racking system. Options include: ""fixed"", ""single-axis"", ""dual-axis"", fixed-rooftop"", ""fixed-split"" (e.g., for split East-West systems)",azimuth of a fixed-tilt array (0=North),tilt of a fixed-tilt array (0=horizontal),A value denoting the compass direction along which the axis of rotation lies. Measured in decimal degrees east of north. [copied from pvlib docs],"The tilt of the axis of rotation (i.e, the y-axis defined by axis_azimuth) with respect to horizontal. axis_tilt must be >= 0 and <= 90. [copied from pvlib docs]. Typically 0.","does it use backtracking (""True"") or True-tracking (""False"")","Target fraction of the array left unshaded by backtracking. E.g., for conventional backtracking where no direct shade is desired, backtrack_fraction is 1.0. To allow half of each row to be shaded, backtrack_fraction = 0.5 would be used.  ","maximum tracker rotation angle to either size of horizontal. Examples of typical values are 45, 52, or 60 degrees","Ground coverage ratio. A value denoting the ground coverage ratio of a tracker system which utilizes backtracking; i.e. the ratio between the PV array surface area to total ground area. A tracker system with modules 2 meters wide, centered on the tracking axis, with 6 meters between the tracking axes has a gcr of 2/6=0.333. gcr must be <=1. [modified from pvlib docs]",The ground coverage ratio value programmed into a system's tracker controllers. Some PV systems use a GCR value slightly higher than the physical design GCR to add a buffer in backtracking and avoid shade that might be caused by uneven terrain or non-uniform tracker axis heights.,DC rated capacity of the plant under Standard Test Conditions (STC),Maximum AC power (nameplate) of the plant at the point of metering or interconnection. Equal to or less than the sum of inverter max AC power values for a plant.,"Type of cells, primarily for shade impact modeling. Options are ""crystalline"", ""crystalline_half-cut"", ""thin-film""","""True"" if modules are bifacial, otherwise ""False""",Ratio of rear performance to front performance under Standard Test Conditions (STC). Typicaly values are 0.65-0.95.,"""portrait"" if the short edge of the module is parallel to the ground, ""landscape"" if the long edge of the module is parallel to the ground.","Number of modules along the side of each row. For example, for a typical ""1P"" (one module in portrait"" tracker, this value is 1.; for ""2P"" tracker or fixed systems, this value is 2, etc.","System losses as a fraction, e.g., 0.10 for 10% losses.","temperature coefficient of power, typically -0.002 to -0.005 per degree Celsius","The angle, relative to horizontal, of the line formed by the intersection between the slope containing the tracker axes and a plane perpendicular to the tracker axes. Cross-axis tilt should be specified using a right-handed convention. For example, trackers with axis azimuth of 180 degrees (heading south) will have a negative cross-axis tilt if the tracker axes plane slopes down to the east and positive cross-axis tilt if the tracker axes plane slopes down to the west. [copied from pvlib docs]",Height of the center point of the row above the ground; must be in the same units as pitch. [copied from pvlib docs] ,"Distance between rows from a common point (e.g., front edge to front edge, NOT front edge to back edge); must be in the same units as height.",DC rated capacity of the array connected to an inverter under Standard Test Conditions (STC),Maximum AC power output of an inverter (real or active power).,Number of modules per string,Number of strings per inverter,Number of inverters in the plant/asset,The full model of module used. Multiple moded can be separated by a semicolon or similar,The full model of inverter used,"Description of shade loss model. Can be ""linear"", ""non-linear_simple"". More could be added later.","Number of cells going up the long axis of the module. 12 is common for 72 cell modules, 24 or 26 is common for twin modules with half-cut cells",,,,"Default transposition model to be used for the site. Can be ""isotropic"", ""haydavies"", ""perez"", ""perez-driesse"""
